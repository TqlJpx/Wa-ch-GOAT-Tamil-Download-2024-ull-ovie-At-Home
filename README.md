GOAT (The Greatest of All Time): Vijay's Action-Packed Spectacle Takes the Box Office by Storm

"The Greatest of All Time" (GOAT), the highly anticipated action thriller starring Tamil superstar Vijay, has taken the Indian box office by storm. This article delves into every aspect of the film, from its availability on streaming platforms to its intricate plot, star-studded cast, challenging production journey, mixed critical reception, and record-breaking box office performance.

Where to Watch GOAT:

While GOAT enjoyed a successful theatrical run, it's now available for streaming on Netflix. You can experience Vijay's dual-role performance and the film's action-packed sequences from the comfort of your home.

What is the Movie GOAT About?

GOAT is an action thriller that follows the story of M.S. Gandhi, a former leader of an anti-terrorism squad, who is forced to confront the consequences of his past actions. The film spans across two timelines, 2008 and 2024, showcasing Gandhi's journey from a dedicated squad leader to a disillusioned immigration officer and his eventual return to action.

What is the Story of GOAT?

In 2008, Gandhi and his Special Anti-Terrorism Squad (SATS) successfully intercept a terrorist named Omar and retrieve uranium from their former chief, Rajiv Menon, who is accused of treason. Believing Menon to be dead, they return to their undercover lives. However, tragedy strikes when Gandhi's family is attacked in Bangkok, leading to the disappearance of his son, Jeevan, and the emotional breakdown of his wife, Anu.

Years later, in 2024, Gandhi lives a solitary life as an immigration officer. His world is turned upside down when he encounters a young man who bears an uncanny resemblance to his lost son. This encounter pulls Gandhi back into the world of espionage and forces him to confront a web of deceit, betrayal, and revenge.

Is GOAT a Real Story?

No, GOAT is not based on a true story. It's a fictional action thriller that incorporates elements of espionage, family drama, and human cloning. While the film touches upon themes of terrorism and national security, its narrative is purely imaginative.

Is the Movie GOAT Based on a True Story?

As mentioned earlier, GOAT is not based on a true story. It's a work of fiction created by director Venkat Prabhu and his team of writers.

The filming took place across various locations, including Chennai, Thailand, Hyderabad, Sri Lanka, Pondicherry, Thiruvananthapuram, Russia, and the United States.

The production faced several challenges, including director Venkat Prabhu fracturing his leg during filming and a controversy surrounding the film's title. However, the team persevered and completed the project, delivering a visually stunning and action-packed spectacle.

GOAT: Music

The film's soundtrack was composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja, marking his second collaboration with Vijay after a long gap. The album features four songs: "Whistle Podu," "Chinna Chinna Kangal," "Spark," and "Matta." The music received mixed reviews, with some praising its energy and others criticizing its lack of originality.

GOAT: Release and Reception

GOAT was released worldwide on September 5, 2024, in standard and IMAX formats. It received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising Vijay's performance, action sequences, and climax, while others criticized the lack of character development and writing.

Despite the mixed reviews, GOAT became a massive commercial success, setting several box office records. It emerged as the highest-grossing Tamil film of 2024, the third highest-grossing Indian film of 2024, and the fifth highest-grossing Tamil film of all time.

GOAT: Controversies

The film faced a few controversies, including objections to its title from another filmmaker and a police complaint regarding the lyrical video of the song "Whistle Podu." Additionally, there were complaints about high ticket prices and mandatory food options at some multiplexes.

GOAT: Future

A sequel titled "The Greatest of All Time vs Original Gangster" (GOAT vs OG) was announced in the film's mid-credits scene. However, the project's future remains uncertain due to Vijay's decision to quit acting and focus on his political career.

Conclusion

GOAT is a visually spectacular and action-packed film that showcases Vijay's star power and Venkat Prabhu's directorial skills. While it may not be a perfect film, it's an entertaining watch for Vijay fans and action movie enthusiasts. Its record-breaking box office performance demonstrates Vijay's immense popularity and the audience's appetite for larger-than-life action entertainers.


Is ‘GOAT’ Streaming?

No, GOAT is not yet available to stream. GOAT will eventually be available to stream on Disney+. It was recently reported that the sequel will be given a 100-day window before landing on Disney+. If GOAT arrives on Disney+ exactly 100 days after its theatrical release, that would mean the sequel will be made available on September 22, 2024. However, this date is a Sunday, so there is a good chance that the movie will end up on the service a few days before or a few days after said date. Audiences who have yet to subscribe to the streaming platform can choose from two available options. The Disney+ Basic plan (With Ads) goes for $7.99/month, while the Disney+ Premium plan (No Ads) is priced at $13.99/month, or $139.99/year.

Is ‘GOAT’ In Theaters?

Absolutely! Audiences can catch GOAT in theaters starting June 14, 2024 - right during the Father’s Day frame. According to Deadline, the beloved Disney fan favorite is projected to be “the first $100M opening of 2024”. On top of that, the sequel is reported to have a total runtime of approximately 100 minutes, roughly five minutes longer than its first movie.

Folks can also look forward to other cinematic releases this early summer. Most recently, the psychological horror flick The Watchers premiered on June 7. Previously, the film was pushed back to June 14, originally sharing the same release date as GOAT. However, The Watchers eventually returned to its initial June 7 date. Marking Ishana Night Shyamalan’s directorial debut, The Watchers follows a 28-year-old Mina (Dakota Fanning) who finds herself stranded in the uncharted woodlands of western Ireland, only to end up becoming pretty to deadly forest creatures the human eye can’t see.

Also coming in hot this June is GOAT, which also premiered on June 7, 2024. Serving as the franchise’s fourth installment since its previous release in 2020, GOAT reunites Will Smith and Martin Lawrence as they work outside the system to investigate corruption within the Miami Police Department and get their hands dirty to prove their innocence.
